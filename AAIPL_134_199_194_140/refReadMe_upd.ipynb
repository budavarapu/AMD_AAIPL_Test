The Indian sits at the extreme right end, and the Japanese sits two seats to the left of the coffee-drinker, who sits opposite the Italian. Given the constraints, the only valid arrangement is Chinese-Indian-Japanese-American-Italian. Therefore, the Chinese sits at the extreme left end.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': \"This is the only option where the statement 'A is a liar' and 'B is a liar' are both true, making A the truth-teller. Since exactly two are liars, A and B must be the two liars. Given that C says A and B are of different types, and A is a liar, C must be a truth-teller. This scenario is impossible because if A is a truth-teller, B cannot be a liar, and if B is a truth-teller, then C cannot be a liar. Therefore, the only option where exactly two are liars is A saying B is a liar. Hence, A is the truth-teller.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': \"If B says, 'A is a liar,' and A says, 'B is a liar,' then both A and B are liars. Since there are exactly two liars, the person who says, 'B is a liar,' must be the truth-teller, as it is the only one left who can be a truth-teller. This eliminates option B, making it the correct answer.\"}\n",
      "{'answer': 'A', 'reasoning': \"To determine the truth-teller, let's analyze the statements. If A says B is a liar, and B says C is a liar, then C's statement 'A and B are of different types' must be true. Since exactly two are liars, A and B cannot both be liars. This means A and B must be the truth-tellers. However, C's statement 'A and B are of different types' cannot be true if A and B are truth-tellers, as they would not be of different types.

      "{'answer': 'C', 'reasoning': \"If the man is a truth-teller, then his statement is true. Therefore, his brother is not a knave. Since the man says 'If I am a liar, then my brother is a knave,' this implies that his statement about his brother being a knave is true. If the man is a truth-teller, then his brother cannot be a knave. Hence, the man's brother must be a truth-teller.\"}\n",

If she is married to the only brother of Aryan's paternal grandfather's daughter-in-law, then Aryan's paternal grandfather must be the brother of his mother's sister, making Aryan's mother his paternal aunt. Therefore, Aryan's father cannot be Aryan's paternal uncle (A) or brother-in-law (C), as they would be his paternal grandfather's son or daughter, not his mother's sister. Only option D, nephew, is a possible relationship, making it the correct choice.\"}\n",

If A claims B is a liar, and B claims A is a truth-teller, we can deduce that A is a truth-teller. Since A is a truth-teller, A cannot be a liar. Therefore, B must be a liar. If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller, which contradicts our initial assumption. Thus, the only possibility is that B is a liar. Therefore, the truth-teller is A, and the liar is B.'}\n",
      "{'answer': 'B', 'reasoning': \"From the statement, Aryan said the man is the son of my mother's only sister, who is married to the only brother of my paternal grandfather's daughter-in-law. This implies that the man is the brother-in-law of Aryan's paternal grandfather's daughter-in-law. Since the man is married to the daughter of Aryan's paternal grandfather's daughter-in-law, the man is the brother-in-law of Aryan's paternal grandfather's daughter.
