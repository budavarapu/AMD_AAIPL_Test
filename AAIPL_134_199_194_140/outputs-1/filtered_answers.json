But if B says A is a liar, then B must be telling the truth, which means A is not a liar. This creates a contradiction, so the only possible conclusion is that A is not a liar, and B is the truth-teller."

        "reasoning": "Since the Chinese sits adjacent to the American, and the American is at the extreme left end, the Chinese must sit at the extreme left end. The Indian sits at the extreme right end, and the Japanese sits two seats to the left of the coffee-drinker, who sits opposite the Italian. Given the constraints, the only valid arrangement is Chinese-Indian-Japanese-American-Italian. Therefore, the Chinese sits at the extreme left end."

        "reasoning": "This is the only option where the statement 'A is a liar' and 'B is a liar' are both true, making A the truth-teller. Since exactly two are liars, A and B must be the two liars. Given that C says A and B are of different types, and A is a liar, C must be a truth-teller. This scenario is impossible because if A is a truth-teller, B cannot be a liar, and if B is a truth-teller, then C cannot be a liar. Therefore, the only option where exactly two are liars is A saying B is a liar. Hence, A is the truth-teller."

        "answer": "A",
        "reasoning": "If B says, 'A is a liar,' and A says, 'B is a liar,' then both A and B are liars. Since there are exactly two liars, the person who says, 'B is a liar,' must be the truth-teller, as it is the only one left who can be a truth-teller. This eliminates option B, making it the correct answer."

Since exactly two are liars, A and B cannot both be liars. This means A and B must be the truth-tellers. However, C's statement 'A and B are of different types' cannot be true if A and B are truth-tellers, as they would not be of different types. Therefore, C must be the truth-teller."

However, if exactly two are liars, then A and B cannot both be liars. Therefore, C must be the truth-teller, as his statement is true. This eliminates A and B, leaving C as the only option. Since C is the truth-teller, he is the correct answer."

Since the man says 'If I am a liar, then my brother is a knave,' this implies that his statement about his brother being a knave is true. If the man is a truth-teller, then his brother cannot be a knave. Hence, the man's brother must be a truth-teller."

If she is married to the only brother of Aryan's paternal grandfather's daughter-in-law, then Aryan's paternal grandfather must be the brother of his mother's sister, making Aryan's mother his paternal aunt. Therefore, Aryan's father cannot be Aryan's paternal uncle (A) or brother-in-law (C), as they would be his paternal grandfather's son or daughter, not his mother's sister. Only option D, nephew, is a possible relationship, making it the correct choice."

Since A is a truth-teller, A cannot be a liar. Therefore, B must be a liar. If B is a liar, then A is a truth-teller, which contradicts our initial assumption. Thus, the only possibility is that B is a liar. Therefore, the truth-teller is A, and the liar is B."

This implies that the man is the brother-in-law of Aryan's paternal grandfather's daughter-in-law. Since the man is married to the daughter of Aryan's paternal grandfather's daughter-in-law, the man is the brother-in-law of Aryan's paternal grandfather's daughter.

Therefore, Arya's paternal grandfather is the brother of Arya's paternal grandfather's daughter-in-law, making Arya's paternal grandfather's daughter-in-law Arya's mother.
