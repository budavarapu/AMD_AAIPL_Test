        "question": "In a society where truth-tellers are revered and liars are persecuted, a group of truth-tellers and liars are asked to work together to maintain order. A group of truth-tellers propose a new law that would penalize liars for spreading false information. If the law is passed, what will be the effect on the social dynamics of the society?",

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "If the law is passed, it will create a strong incentive for truth-tellers to conform and punish liars. This will lead to a decrease in the number of liars, as they will be more likely to be ostracized. However, this will also lead to a loss of diversity and creativity, as liars will be less likely to contribute to the society. Ultimately, the law will create a more uniform society, but at the cost of stifling innovation and individuality."
