If P is a liar, then Q is a truth-teller. If Q is a truth-teller, then R is a truth-teller. If R is a truth-teller, then P is a liar, which is consistent.

If C is the truth-teller, then A is a liar, making B a truth-teller, which also contradicts the condition.

This satisfies the condition of exactly one knight (C). If A were the knight, B would be a knave, and C would be a knight, contradicting the one knight rule. If B were the knight, C would be a knight, also contradicting the rule. Thus, C is the only consistent knight."
