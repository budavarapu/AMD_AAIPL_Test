        "explanation": "Assume P is a truth-teller: then Q is a liar. If Q is a liar, then R is not a truth-teller. If R is a liar, then P is not a liar, which contradicts P being a truth-teller. So P cannot be truthful. Try P as liar: then Q is not a liar, so Q is truthful. If Q is truthful, then R is a truth-teller. If R is truthful, then P is a liar, which fits.
