However, this leads to two liars (Y and Z), contradicting the condition. If Z is the truth-teller, then X is a liar, making Y a truth-teller (from Z's statement), again contradicting the condition. The only consistent scenario is Y being the truth-teller, making Z a liar and X a liar, but this leads to two liars, not one.
